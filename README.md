## Challenges and Learning

Throughout the development of Pixel Fighters, our team encountered several challenges that tested our skills and pushed us to learn new technologies and methodologies:

- **Character Animation:** Implementing smooth and responsive animations for the characters was initially difficult. We had to experiment with frame rates and sprite sheet configurations to achieve the desired fluidity in movements and attacks.
  
- **Collision Detection:** Handling precise collision detection between characters and various elements (such as traps and power-ups) required careful tuning. We learned how to balance performance with accuracy in a fast-paced game environment.

- **Audio Integration:** Integrating 8-bit sound effects and music that matched the retro aesthetic of the game involved both creative and technical challenges. We had to ensure that the sound effects were not only engaging but also appropriately timed with in-game actions.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring that the game played well on different screen sizes, while maintaining the pixel-art integrity, was a balancing act. We learned to use CSS media queries and Bootstrap effectively to adapt the UI without losing the retro feel.

While Pixel Fighters is fully functional, there are several enhancements and features we plan to add in the future:

- **Online Multiplayer:** Implementing an online multiplayer mode where players can battle against each other over the internet.
  
- **Additional Characters and Levels:** Expanding the game by adding more characters with unique abilities and designing new levels with varied environments and challenges.

- **AI Opponent:** Adding an AI-controlled opponent for single-player mode, with adjustable difficulty levels to cater to players of all skill levels.

- **Leaderboards and Achievements:** Introducing a leaderboard system and achievements to increase replayability and competitiveness among players.

- **Mobile Optimization:** Further optimizing the game for mobile devices to ensure smooth gameplay on smaller screens and touch controls.
